IMPORTANT ROUTINES

Trap #0 - clear data
    a0 address
    d7 # of qwords
Trap #1 - copy
    a0 source
    a1 dest
    d7 # of bytes
PlaneMapToRAM
    a0 map location
    a1 RAM address
    d1 #cols
    d2 #rows
QueueDMACommands
    d0 source address (word address, so div 2)
    d1 VDP destination RAM address
    d2 transfer length (words)
    
a6 is pretty much always the VDP control port, so writes there
   writes to VDP
a5 is usually the VDP data port
USUALLY autoincrement is set to 2

You can "double write" using move.l if you want to write 2 values
quickly. The 68K write a dword high word first, then low to the "shadow"
VDP control register. This saves a bit of time and instruction space.

VDP use: ScrollA: $C000 Window: $0000 Scroll B: $E000 Sprites: $F000
HSCroll address: $F400 default scroll 64x32 cell

$80xx - Mode set 1     $81xx - Mode set 2
$82xx - Scroll A       $83xx - Window         $84xx - Scroll B
$85xx - Sprite table   $87xx - Background clr $8Axx - HINT
$8Bxx - Mode set 3     $8Cxx - Mode set 4     $8Dxx - HScroll table
$8Fxx - Auto increment $90xx - Scroll size    $91xx - Window horz
$92xx - Window vert    $93xx - DMA count low  $94xx - DMA count hi
$95xx - DMA source low $96xx - DMA source mid $97xx - DMA source high
